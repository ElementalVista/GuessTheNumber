This project is a simple "Guess the Number" game that involves moving elements with a responsive interface throughout gameplay of guessing a number randomly chosen from 1 to 20.


What I learned:
-To effectively optimize code using the refactoring method and the DRY principle.
-To create moving elements using keyframes within CSS.
